# Calculus

This was my Calculus Project at grade 12 i basically made an app (idk if i would call it an app cuz u use the terminal but whatever) that solves three types of calculus questions:

1.find the area under the curve using Trapezoid Rule 

2.find the area under the curve using Simpsons Rule 

3.find the derivative of f(x) using the Power Rule

I know its really bad ui at the time i barely knew anything abt java fx 
You need to setup javafx if you will run the ui file otherwise you can just run the other files separately
