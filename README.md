# Calculus
This was my Calculus Project at grade 12 i basically made an app (idk if i would call it an app cuz u use the terminal but whatever) that solves three types of calculus questions 1.find the area under the curve using Trapezoidal Rule  2.find the area under the curve using Simpsons Rule 3.find the power rule of f(x)
